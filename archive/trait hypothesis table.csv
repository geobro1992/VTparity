Terrestrial,Egg or juvenile,Size relative to adult mass,Gravity,Decrease,Decrease,Gravid females and offspring must support own weight. Viviparity clearly disadvantageous for this reason (eg birds)
Terrestrial,Egg or juvenile,Size relative to adult mass,Desiccation,Increase,Decrease,Larger progeny less likely to dry out. Viviparity or other parental care advantagous for this reason
Terrestrial,Egg or juvenile,Size relative to adult mass,Temperature,Decrease,Increase,"Higher temps = smaller offspring. This could differ between endo- and ecto-therms, but worth noting that for both, the range of temperatures experienced on land is much greater than in the water"
Terrestrial,Egg or juvenile,Size relative to adult mass,Predation,Increase,Decrease,"Bigger offspring are better but this trades off with offspring number/clutch size, which is itself constrained by adult body size"
Terrestrial,Egg or juvenile,Size relative to adult mass,Resource competition,Decrease ,Decrease,Usually bigger offspring require more resources  
Terrestrial,Adult,Body size,Gravity,Decrease ,Decrease,Adults must support their own weight
Terrestrial,Adult,Body size,Desiccation,Increase,Decrease,Larger individuals less likely to dry out
Terrestrial,Adult,Body size,Temperature,Decrease,Increase,Elevated temperautres are associated with smaller body sizes
Terrestrial,Adult,Body size,Predation,Increase ,Decrease,there is a trade-off with age at first reproduction
Terrestrial,Adult,Body size,Resource competition,Decrease,Increase,Intra-specific competiton can select for larger size if size advantage increases foraging success - but it is tricky to think about within- vs. between species patterns  
Aquatic,Egg or juvenile,Size relative to adult mass,Dispersal,Decrease ,Increase,Small eggs/larvae can presumably be passively transported greater distances - but if viviparity or other precocial investment evolves this does not hold (Neuheimer et al. 2015)
Aquatic,Egg or juvenile,Size relative to adult mass,Predation,Increase ,Decrease,bigger offspring are better but this trades off with offspring number
Aquatic,Egg or juvenile,Size relative to adult mass,Resource competition,Decrease,Increase, Intra-specific competiton can select for larger size if size advantage increases foraging success - but it is tricky to think about within- vs. between species patterns 
Aquatic,Egg or juvenile,Size relative to adult mass,Dissolved oxygen,Mixed ,unknown,"Oxygen supply has been argued to lead to selection for reduced egg size because of surface-to-volume constraints, but empirical research does not support this idea (Hendry, Day, and Rowe 2003)"
Aquatic,Adult,Body size,Temperature,Decrease,unknown,Elevated temperautres are associated with smaller body sizes
Aquatic,Adult,Body size,Predation,Increase ,unknown,but trades off with age at maturity
Aquatic,Adult,Body size,Sexual selection (Males),increase ,Decrease,Male body size is the most common trait under directional sexual selection
Aquatic,Adult,Body size,Fecundity selection (females),increase ,Decrease,"Femlaes that are larger have higher clutch sizes in most, if not all, species with indeterminate growth (ectotherms) - marine mammals are an exception, and this is true within viviparous fish but not between viviparous and externally brooding fish"
Aquatic,Adult,Body size,Resource competition,Increase ,Increase,small eggs/larvae can presumably be passively transported greater distances - but if viviparity or other precocial investment evolves this does not hold (Neuheimer et al. 2015)
Terrestrial,Adult,Clutch Size,Resource competition,Increase,unknown," Large clutches and/or synchronous reproduction can be selected to saturate predators. Body size, maturation age, and offspring size will all trade off with this trait"
Terrestrial,Adult,Clutch Size,Predation,Increase  ,unknown," Large clutches and/or synchronous reproduction can be selected to saturate predators, but gravity constraints may oppose it. Body size, maturation age, and offspring size will all trade off with this trait"
Aquatic,Adult,Clutch Size,Predation,Increase  ,unknown," Large clutches and/or synchronous spawning can be selected to saturate predators. Body size, maturation age, and offspring size will all trade off with this trait"
Aquatic,Adult,Clutch Size,Resource competition,Increase,unknown," Large clutches and/or synchronous spawning can be selected to saturate predators. Body size, maturation age, and offspring size will all trade off with this trait"
Terrestrial,Adult,Age at maturation (first reproduction),Predation,Decrease ,unknown,Age at maturation will be later with higher survival (larger body size)
Aquatic,Adult,Age at maturation (first reproduction),Predation,Decrease ,unknown,Age at maturation will be later with higher survival (larger body size)
Terrestrial,Adult,Age at maturation (first reproduction),Resource competition,Increase,unknown,"Growth will be slower, and maturation later, when resources are limited"
Aquatic,Adult,Age at maturation (first reproduction),Resource competition,Increase,unknown,"Growth will be slower, and maturation later, when resources are limited"
Aquatic,Adult,Lifespan (longevity),Predation,Decrease ,unknown,Predation will shape body size and lifespan at the same time
Aquatic,Adult,Lifespan (longevity),Resource competition,Increase,unknown,Typically species that evolve to be good competitors live a long time (slow life histories)
Terrestrial,Adult,Lifespan (longevity),Predation,Decrease ,unknown,Predation will shape body size and lifespan at the same time
Terrestrial,Adult,Lifespan (longevity),Resource competition,Increase,unknown,Typically species that evolve to be good competitors live a long time (slow life histories)
